Lydia - Getting Started</h2><section class='answer-block'><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mEXPu9UHRJ4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0mDswCR9tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hEPtoDeU0oI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><br></span></p></section><h2 class='section-title'>2. How To Install Your Theme</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>To install your theme in WordPress you must navigate to the menu "Appearance" on the left and then the submenu "Themes". From that page you should see your current theme "Twenty Eleven" by default OR whatever theme you currently have. Now click the "Install Themes" tab and then the text button at the top "Upload". You then should click Choose File and find your theme files on your computer and upload them. Note: You are only uploading the folder "themename.zip" Your final step is to "Activate" your theme.
</p><p>This process is shown in the images below
</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/9261451824.jpg">
</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/2411673267.jpg">

</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/6223133772.jpg">
</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/7487022289.jpg">
</p><p>By default the pagenames will be <code>website.com/p15</code> instead of <code>website.com/about</code>.
</p><p>To fix this go to <code>"Settings" &gt; "Permalinks"</code> and change to <code>"Post Name"</code>. After choosing "Post Name", Click "Save Changes" and your done. Your urls will now display a proper Permalink structure.
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>3. Installing Theme Plugins</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>When you first install the theme you'll see a popup on your dashboard from the theme asking you to install a number of plugins.
</p><p>Allow the theme to install these for you. The plugins which are installed are dependent of the theme, the images below are for illustrative purposes only.</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/1241706972.png"><br>
</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/1302247153.png"><br>
</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5229829522.png">
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>4. Importing Demo Data (Auto Method)</h2><section class='answer-block'><h4>Importing Demo Data (Auto Method)</h4><p>To use demo demo data installer go to <code>"appearance" =&gt; "customise"</code> from your WP Dashboard. Inside the customiser (this is also the theme options panel, you can modify loads about the theme from here) click on the <code>"Import Demo Data"</code> tab. Next click the <code>"Import Demo Data"</code> Button, a backup prompt will appear, click OK when you're ready on this, and then leave your install until you get a successful message. This process takes up to 15 mins. Do not do anything during this process!.
</p><p><code>Developers: If you have wp_debug set to true, this process will fail, set to false whilst importing demo data.</code>

</p><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/7778255751.png"><br>
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>5. Importing Demo Data (Fallback Method)</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>I have created a folder labeled <code>"Demo XML Data"</code> which contains an export for the Live Preview. The place to upload this XML file is in WordPress under <code>Tools &gt; Import</code>.
</p><p>Once you've arrived on the Import page, you will click on the "WordPress" link: Wordpress - Install the WordPress importer to import posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags from a WordPress export file.
</p><p>The first time you do this you will get a pop-up prompting you to install the "WordPress Importer". You will need to click "Install Now". Then You will have installed the plugin and need to click "Activate Plugin & Run Importer".
</p><p>From here you will just need click "Choose File" and select the demo-data.xml file. Then click "Upload file and import".
</p><p>You will then be prompted to Assign Authors. You can read the description at the top as this explains everything. Note: Make sure you Import Attachments.
</p><p>Check the box "Download and import file attachments". This will download attachments for images included in the Live Preview demo.
</p><p>You now just need to wait for the importer to finish. This might take a few minutes depending on your hosting server speed.
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>6. Troubleshooting Your Installation</h2><section class='answer-block'><ol>
    <li><code>Demo data installed correctly, but there's no imges?</code> You either forgot to import attachments when installing demo data, or your server is configured to not allow incoming attachments. You'll need to go through the theme, posts, portfolios and set featured images accordingly.</li>
    <li><code>Seeing a red warning where a revolution slider should be?</code> You just need to import the demo slider included in your themes Demo XML Data folder provided in your package (see video above).</li>
    <li><code>No Menus?! Help!</code> This is simple, go to <code>appearance -&gt; menus</code> and set your registered menus to a theme location.</li>
    <li><code>I'm getting 404 errors on posts & pages.</code> See the permalinks section of this documentation.</li>
<li><code>My site is slow to load & pages.</code> See <a href="http://www.madeinebor.com/things-check-leaving-support-ticket/"  rel="nofollow">this article</a>.</li>
</ol></section><h2 class='section-title'>7. Initial Theme Setup</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>From your WP Dashboard go to <code>"settings" =&gt; "reading"</code> and click the <code>"static homepage"</code> option. Let's set the "home page" to any of the "home layout" pages, and let's set the "posts page" option to "blog", once you've done this hit the save changes button. You now have a proper homepage, and a proper blog page, nice one :)
</p><p>Now the last step. Go to <code>appearance -&gt; menus</code> and set the theme menus in place. Use the checkboxes at the bottom of the menus to set them in location. Set the main menu into the <code>primary</code> location.
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>8. Lydia - Theme Options</h2><section class='answer-block'><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YQy2ZbAm7NE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></p><p>All options for the theme are found within the WordPress theme customizer, from here you can change logos, colours, loads of stuff!
</p><p>When you've done making changes, be sure to click the <code>Save Changes</code> button to apply your modificaitons to the front end of the site.

</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>9. Setting Up A Logo</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>Head to the theme options and open the <code style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6;">header settings & logo</code> area, use the appropriate logo controls within.</p><p>The recommended logo height for the theme is 63px, width can be anything but remember that the logo may bump into your navigation if it’s width is too high.</p><h4>Heads Up!</h4><p><em>In your theme you can adjust the logo size (height) in the same area that you upload your logo! Sweet!</em></p><h4>Heads Up!</h4><p><em>Your retina logo needs to have @2x on the end of the filename. Because of the way WordPress handles media attachments, make sure your logo filenames are truly unique so that the retina logo can be swapped properly</em></p></section><h2 class='section-title'>10. Modifying Fonts &amp; Font Colours</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>To modify fonts & fonts colours, you'll want to install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-google-fonts/"  rel="nofollow">Easy Google Fonts</a> plugin, it's fantastic.
</p><p><code>Advanced:</code> for very specific font control, you can add additional selectors to the plugin if you need to. To do this have a watch of this video:
</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/77878709" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></p><p><span></span></p></section><h2 class='section-title'>11. Theme Post Type Options</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>Our themes allow you to control the urls used for the provided post types (such as team, portfolio etc). The Post Type Options page can be found within Settings in your WP admin area.</p><p>By standard, the usual url for your portfolio items would be yoururl.com/portfolio - however, using the provided area you can replace 'portfolio' with whatever slug you wish to use! The same principal applies to other post types also, depending on the theme in use.</p><p>Once you have changed your slug you may recieve a 404 error when trying to access your items, to remedy this, simply head to Settings &gt; Permalinks and hit save. This refreshed WP permalink settings and should resolve this for you.</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>12. Lydia - Portfolio Posts</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>
	<iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BcnK43pnjaE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
	</iframe></p><h6>Heads Up!</h6><p>A single portfolio post represents a singular image within the portfolio post feeds on the site. Portfolio posts are automatically show at /portfolio/ on your site, though you can use the page builder to add these to a page instead.
</p><p>Portfolio posts function exactly in the same way as blog posts. Any additional features of a portfolio post can be modified in the <code>additional portfolio settings</code> section underneath the WP Editor when making a portfolio post, take a look through these options, and make a mental note of what they offer.
</p><h6>Heads Up!</h6><p>Each Portfolio post MUST have a featured image set. This image should be a minimum of 440px X 330px and should have a maxiumum width of 2000px
</p><p>To change the layout of a portfolio post from full width to left/right, just use the portfolio layout control in the<code>additional portfolio settings</code>.
</p><h6>Custom Cropping Featured Images</h6><p>It’s very likely you’ll want deeper control of how the theme crops your featured images to be shown in the main portfolio feeds. If you installed the plugins recommended by the theme, then you’re ready to do this. After you’ve set your featured image, click the <code>crop image</code> link underneath <code>remove featured image</code>, a window will pop-up. With the window open, choose the <code>portfolio</code> tab and then adjust and crop your image. Finally update your post. When you take a look at your site, if the image has not updated <code>clear your browser cache!</code>
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>13. Contact Form 7 Overview</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>Contact Form 7 is our recommended form plugin for WordPress. It is a simple but powerful form creator for WordPress. Here we will show you how to use Contact Form 7 to create and edit a basic form.
</p><p>After Contact Form 7 is installed, you’ll find a new menu item in your WordPress admin area called Contact, here is where your forms and created and edited. From the Contact main screen, you will see your first contact form, its usually a default form called 'Contact Form 1' OR if you have imported the demo data for our theme you may see a few forms that we have made specially for you.</p><p>When creating and editing forms CF7 uses simple shortcodes (in WordPress these shortcodes are words surrounded by square brackets like “[” and “]”) - these shortcodes are generated via the 'Generate Tag' area (marked in red) and then placed in the form builder area (marked in blue) - you can also add your own HTML to the form for extra control.</p><p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lmXHPXpppjM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></p></section><h2 class='section-title'>14. Team Posts</h2><section class='answer-block'><h4>Heads Up!</h4><p><em>Team posts are automatically show at /team/ on your site, though you can use the page builder to add these to a page instead.</em></p><p>Team posts work just like blog posts. Ensure each team post has a featured image set. You’ll also want to set a job title, and some social icons for each team member using the additional inputs underneath the WP Editor/</p><p><em></em>
</p></section><h2 class='section-title'>15. Installing WooCommerce</h2><section class='answer-block'><p>Your theme is ready for WooCommerce if you need eCommerce in your theme. There’s 2 steps to set this up, but you should also consider installing my demo data with WooCommerce pages and posts to make your life easier after setting up the plugin.
</p><h4>Install WooCommerce</h4><p><img src="https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/6620331510.jpg">
</p><p>Go to “plugins” =&gt; “add-new” =&gt; “install” and search for WooCommerce & then run the installer.
</p><h4>Run the Woo Setup Wizard</h4><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ji8q4eU.jpg" alt="">
</p><p>Once activated, WooCommerce will take you to a setup screen - simply follow along each set of options and <strong>allow WooCommerce to install and setup</strong> the pages for you.</p><h4>Install WooCommerce Demo Data</h4><p>By far the easiest way to use WooCommerce is to first install the WooCommerce demo data and then configure it to your needs, you already have all the required WooCommerce pages installed so now we just need to populate them.
</p><p>Head to the <code>Demo XML Data</code> folder in your download, the data we’re after is called <code>woocommerce.xml</code>
</p><p>For details on importing this data, head to the <code>Installing the demo data</code> section of this documentation.
</p><h4>WooCommerce is now set up</h4><p>That’s all you need to do to get a fully functioning shop within your theme, with the WooCommerce pages installed and with the WooCommerce demo data installed you’re ready to rock.
</p><p>You may want a little more help with how to use WooCommerce though, well your theme does not modify any of the default WooCommerce methods of working, so by far the best resource for WooCommerce now is that already written by WooThemes themselves, below is a selection of links worth visiting;
